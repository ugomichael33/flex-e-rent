                           No, because property managers don’t guarantee you market-rate rent, nor do they have aligned incentives to find great tenants for your property. Plus, no property manager offers the same flexible management plans as Flex+E+Rent. 
                           Yes, because we offer the basic services you’d expect of a property manager: marketing, leasing, rent collection, etc. However, we go above and beyond with optional maintenance and repairs, brokerage services, guaranteed rent, the best-of-the-best tenants, and more.
